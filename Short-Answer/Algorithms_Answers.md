#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
    - multiple n's simplify to n
    - assignment operators run once

b) O(n^2)
    - nested loops
    - assignment operators run once

c) O(1)
    - recursion uses memory (line 29)

## Exercise II
## def buiding_floors(stories, floor):
## keep track of broken eggs
## **base case** 
## if stories == 0 return broken eggs
## if dropped from above f, incremment broken eggs
